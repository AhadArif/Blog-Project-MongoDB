## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

### **1. Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Free Cluster Setup)

### **2. Database Setup**
1. **Sign Up for MongoDB**  
   - Visit [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/) and create a free account.
   - Set up a **free database cluster**.
   - Obtain your MongoDB connection URI (you'll use this in the next step).

2. **Create `.env` File**  
   - In the root directory of the project, create a `.env` file.
   - Add your database URI and secret key as shown below:

     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@clusterName.xxxxxxx.mongodb.net/<database>
     JWT_SECRET=MySecretBlog

   Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<clusterName>`, and `<database>` with your actual MongoDB credentials and database name.
